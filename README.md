For now, we attempt to download only district-wise data, which has 104 indicators. NFHS also provides state-wise data too, which contain statistics for a few more indicators. All *code* in this repository is released under the MIT License. 

## Downloading district-wise data

1. District wise data is available at [this link](http://rchiips.org/nfhs/districtfactsheet_NFHS-5.shtml) ([web archive link](http://web.archive.org/web/20211213200517/http://rchiips.org/nfhs/districtfactsheet_NFHS-5.shtml)). 

2. From this webpage, we get the links to each of the statewise pages, which is saved in the `statewise_district_links.csv` file. 

3. Then, the `get_districtwise_links.py` script is used to compile the list of all district wise file URLs into `districtwise_links.csv`. 

4. `download_all_districts.py` is used to download PDFs and save them to `districtwise_data/pdfs`. During this process, it appears that the webpages for one state ([Telangana](http://rchiips.org/nfhs/NFHS-5_TL.shtml)) and one Union Territory ([Chandigarh](http://rchiips.org/nfhs/NFHS-5_CH.shtml)), currently point to a `404` page. So data for these. 

5. It looks like district wise data for `Telangana` is available in the [Telangana State Compendium](http://rchiips.org/nfhs/NFHS-5_FCTS/COMPENDIUM/Telangana.pdf) - we slice this file up, district wise and save the PDFs in the `districtwise_data/telangana` folder. `Chandigarh` has only one district, which covers the entire union territory, so it probably won't have any separate "district-wise" data, as such.

6. There are `704` district-wise PDF files, totalling to approximately `450MB` of data.  

7. With all this done, we use `parse_pdf.py` to parse the PDF and dump district wise data to JSON (in the directory `districtwise_data/json/`. This script uses [Tabula](https://github.com/chezou/tabula-py) and [pdfminer.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six) for parsing PDFs.

8. In the first round of PDF parsing, we used the `parse_pdf.py` script at commit `ce4f8ee`. Out of the 704 PDFs, we could generate JSONs successfully for only 563 files. 141 PDFs resulted in errors, which are listed below, along with what was done to solve the errors:

Turns out Raigarhs file has 7 pages (one blank page extra on page 6). Also, added a Tabula template file for this. Thane's error was being caused due to a nan/empty value in the 'Indicator' column. |

9. The Tabula `template` files were generated manually by dragging and selecting the tables using the [Tabula Desktop app](https://tabula.technology/) for Linux. The saved template files are located in the directory `tabula_templates` in this repository. Tabula 1.2.1, which was downloaded from [this link](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula/releases/download/v1.2.1/tabula-jar-1.2.1.zip) (sha256sum: `fea6a5d26e2ab1abf2cc0a694d93810c59e93e0ce9190fce31541fdf6e7e6ece  tabula-jar-1.2.1.zip`).
